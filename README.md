# üìß Email Spam Filtering System

A machine learning-based Email Spam Filtering System developed using Python and Scikit-learn. This project classifies incoming emails as **Spam** or **Ham (legitimate)** using a trained Random Forest classifier with probability calibration for better reliability.

## üìñ About the Project

The Email Spam Filtering System aims to automatically detect and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones using machine learning techniques. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on labeled email datasets and applies **TF-IDF vectorization** for text feature extraction.

The system can be integrated with a local email server setup using **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **Procmail** for real-time spam filtering on received emails.
